This team  work together to develop a simple class manager application
making heavy use of GitHub Copilot to generate the code. This application should
provide a simple REST API for managing teachers and students stored in a
PostgreSQL database. The application should have the following endpoints:
● GET /teachers - Get a list of all teachers
● GET /teachers/{id} - Get a specific teacher by ID
● POST /teachers - Create a new teacher
● PUT /teachers/{id} - Update an existing teacher
● DELETE /teachers/{id} - Delete a teacher by ID
● GET /students - Get a list of all students
● GET /students/{id} - Get a specific student by ID
● POST /students - Create a new student
● PUT /students/{id} - Update an existing student
● DELETE /students/{id} - Delete a student by ID
